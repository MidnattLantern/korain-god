                <p>By adding guidelines and measurements to the elements, I was able to spot where things needed to align perfectly: in halves, thirds, or along shared axes.</p>

                <p>The "Curve" tool in Blender works the same way as in Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Designer: nodes connected with lines, and handles determining the sharpness of the curves. The only differences are the buttons and interface, so for me, the only learning curve was figuring out which buttons to press.</p>
                <li>In Object Mode, press Shift + A and select "Bezier" or "Circle".</li>
                <li>Go to Edit Mode, select everything, and delete it to get a blank object.</li>
                <li>You'll find "Draw" and "Curve Pen" in the toolbar. They work like the "Pen" and "Pencil" tools in Affinity Designer. The Select Box is Blender's equivalent of the Node Tool in Illustrator/Designer. Use the G key to move a selected node or handle. Select two nodes and join them with the F key. Toggle between sharp and smooth nodes with the V key while selected: "Vector" makes it sharp, "Aligned" makes it curvy again. To cut a line, select two nodes, press the Y key, then delete it.</li>
                <img src={BlenderDesignerComparisonImage} alt={"Couldn't load image"}/>
                <li>Converting is easy: go back to Object Mode, right-click, and choose "Convert to Mesh".</li>
                <img src={SketchToThreeDimensionalImage} alt={"Couldn't load image"}/>
                <p>{`I worked with one half. I realized I should've used the Mirror modifier to finish the other half, instead I copied and rotated along the horizontal axis. This is bad practice because when you solidify, the substance will be misaligned and twisted, even with the offset set to zero, and hidden issues will backfire. Remember to use Mirror for such instances â€” it's a more elegant solution. Despite everything, I ended up with a visually functional rendering of the object, but the mesh is far more resource-heavy than necessary.`}</p>

                <p>The symbol is split to different components making out the outline, the solid part of the scale, and the surrounding circle.</p>
                <img src={ThreeDimensionalComponentsImage} alt={"Couldn't load image"}/>
                <p>Going through all this provide convenience and flexibility to accurately trace different angles if necessary, for this piece, straight head on did the work. It also auto-generates shadows and dept that will be of use later on.</p>

                <p>Chromatic aberration splits the red, green, and blue channels. When used well, it can enhance the image to look less static and give it an unreal effect.</p>
                <p>Clip Studio Paint (version 1.0) does not have an effective tool to split the channels, but I was able to split them through Affinity Photo.</p>
                <p>{'Affinity Photo has a channels window. By disabling a channel as "editable", you can split and achieve chromatic aberration. This symbol is circular, so I used the "Lens Distortion" effect (Found inside Filters > Distort > Lens Distortion). The image below demonstrates an intense lens distortion effect.'}</p>
