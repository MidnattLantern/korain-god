                <h1>Modeling the scale</h1>
                <p>Regarding the model design of the scale, I could reuse parts from the one I made for the <Link to="/symbol">symbol</Link>, which contained mistakes and ineffective and performance heavy typology. It was so bad, my M1 8GB-RAM MacBook couldn't even open the document anymore and I had to switch to my beefier Ryzen-5 3600*12 16GB-RAM PC to work on it. I needed to do it from scratch with better typology â€” on my PC just to be sure. This new reiteration had cleaner typology and better collections management.</p>
                <p>By design, the anatomy of the "fins" and the "wings" are twisting. But that wasn't illustrated up until this point as the previous inclusion featured 2-dimensional renders.</p>
                <img src={TwistingFinsImage} alt="TwistingFinsImage"/>
                <p>I captured the outlines with the curve tool again, merge to a flat mesh, then twist it. My method of twisting included the "Simple Deform" modifier. I recommend holding the mesh as close to its origin point in the Edit Mode as close as possible when starting out, then play around with the X Y Z values, as you carefully go from there.</p>
                <p>With one fin twisted, next, applying mirror:</p>
                <div className={Styles.ShareTwo}>
                    <img src={MirrorWingImage}/>
                    <img src={FinImage} alt="FinImage"/>
                </div>
                <p>After that, I applied a solidify modifier, and repeated the same steps of the other wings/ fins.</p>
                <img src={WingSolidifyImage} alt="WingSolidifyImage"/>
                <p>Each component was formed in front of a sketch.</p>
                <img src={FrontOfSketchImage} alt="FrontOfSketchImage"/>
                <p>The major anatomical components are: the pole/ crown, the wings, the left and right cups. They're linked to individual bones that can be used for tilting it like a functional scale, even if you import it as an FBX file to Unity.</p>

                    <img src={BoneCanTiltImage} alt="BoneCanTiltImage"/>

                <Chapter>
                    <h1>Modeling the shrine</h1>
                    <p>The shrine is described as a pedestal with a functional scale made of copper. To stay true to the theme among the other shrines in the World of Idoria, I did borrow elements from the <a href="https://midnattlantern.github.io/mora-goddess/" target="_blank">shrine design of Mora.</a></p>
                    <img src={MoraShrineImage} alt="MoraShrineImage"/>
                    <p>These are the designs I proposed:</p>
                    <img src={RenditionOptionsImage}/>
                    <p>We went with the first option, but making the table circular as well.</p>
                </Chapter>

                <Chapter>
                <h1>Painting</h1>
                <p>I made renditions,  I could trace over the render with masked layers that made up thresholds of the shrine. I stuck to as few layers as possible by marking out every other threshold, then locking the transparency. The podium just needed two 'threshold' layers, while the scale needed three.</p>
                <div className={Styles.ShareTwo}>
                    <img src={ScaleTraceImage} alt="ScaleTraceImage"/>
                    <img src={ShadowSectionImage} alt="ShadowOutlineImage"/>
                </div>
                <p>The scale itself being more complex was divided into three layers, making it easier to maintain the shading. The following image demonstrates the sections as vibrant colors:</p>
                <img src={SymbolSectionsImage} alt="SymbolSectionsImage"/>
                <p>With the layers set up individually and pixels locked, I can easily shade them with marking tool.</p>
                <img src={MarkAndShadeImage} alt="MarkAndShadeImage"/>
                <p>After making a grayscale render that I'm happy with, I could merge the layers and bring out colors with the "color balance" correction tool, and using "overlay" and "color dodge" layer styles. For the podium I added a rough stone texture layer set to a low opacity and "Multiply".</p>
                <img src={LevelShiftImage} alt="LevelShiftImage"/>
                <p>For the copper scale, I awakened the metallic feel with an "Add glow" overlay layer, it's a helpful layer style for getting vibrant effects such as sunlight or a metallic glow.</p>
